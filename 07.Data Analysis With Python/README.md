# Data Analysis with Python
## üìë Summary
Data analysis involves the systematic manipulation, refinement, and interpretation of unprocessed data to derive meaningful insights and facilitate informed decision-making in business. This method minimizes decision-related uncertainties by providing valuable statistics and actionable information, often visualized through charts, images, tables, and graphs.

## üîë Key Skills Learned
- Collecting and importing data 
- Cleaning, preparing & formatting data 
- Data frame manipulation 
- Summarizing data 
- Building machine learning regression models 
- Model refinement 
- Creating data pipelines

### Module 1 Importing Datasets:
- Define the Business Problem: Look at the data and make some high-level decision on what kind of analysis should be done
- Import and Export Data in Python: How to import data from multiple data sources using the Pandas library and how to export files into different formats.
- Analyze Data in Python: How to do some introductory analysis in Python using functions like dataframe.head() to view the first few lines of the dataset, dataframe.info() to view the column names and data types.

### Module 2 Data Wrangling:
- Identify and Handle Missing Values: Drop rows with incomplete information and impute missing data using the mean values.
- Understand Data Formatting: Wrangle features in a dataset and make them meaningful for data analysis.
- Apply normalization to a data set: By understanding the relevance of using feature scaling on your data and how normalization and standardization have varying effects on your data analysis.
  
### Module 3 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Describe Exploratory Data Analysis: By summarizing the main characteristics of the data and extracting valuable insights.
- Compute basic descriptive statistics: Calculate the mean, median, and mode using python and use it as a basis in understanding the distribution of the data.
- Create data groups: How and why you put continuous data in groups and how to visualize them.
- Define correlation as the linear association between two numerical variables: Use Pearson correlation as a measure of the correlation between two continuous variables.
- Define the association between two categorical variables: Understand how to find the association of two variables using the Chi-square test for association and how to interpret them.

### Module 4 Model Development
- Define the explanatory variable and the response variable: Define the response variable (y) as the focus of the experiment and the explanatory variable (x) as a variable used to explain the change of the response variable. Understand the differences between Simple Linear Regression because it concerns the study of only one explanatory variable and Multiple Linear Regression because it concerns the study of two or more explanatory variables.
- Evaluate the model using Visualization: By visually representing the errors of a variable using scatterplots and interpreting the results of the model.
- Identify alternative regression approaches: Use a Polynomial Regression when the Linear regression does not capture the curvilinear relationship between variables and how to pick the optimal order to use in a model.
- Interpret the R-square and the Mean Square Error: Interpret R-square (x 100) as the percentage of the variation in the response variable y  that is explained by the variation in explanatory variable(s) x. The Mean Squared Error tells you how close a regression line is to a set of points. It does this by taking the average distances from the actual points to the predicted points and squaring them.

### Module 5 Model Evaluation
- Identify over-fitting and under-fitting in a predictive model: Overfitting occurs when a function is too closely fit to the training data points and captures the noise of the data. Underfitting refers to a model that can't model the training data or capture the trend of the data.
- Apply Ridge Regression to linear regression models: Ridge regression is a regression that is employed in a Multiple regression model when Multicollinearity occurs.
- Tune hyper-parameters of an estimator using Grid search: Grid search is a time-efficient tuning technique that exhaustively computes the optimum values of hyperparameters performed on specific parameter values of estimators.
