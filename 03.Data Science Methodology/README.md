# Data Science Methodology
## 🔑 Key Skills Learned
- The use of methodologies to solve business problems in a structured, consistent manner.
- An understanding of the importance of methodologies in data science.
## 📑 Summary of Learning
### Module 1:
- Business Understanding: Identify the problem and goal you are trying to solve using data.
- Analytical Approach: Determine how data can be used to answer the question and achieve the goal.
- Types of Analytical Approaches: Predictive models (probabilities of an action), descriptive models (showing relationships), classification models (categorizing data).
- Data Requirements: Define the necessary data content, formats, and sources for decision-tree classification.
- Data Collection: Gather the required data, even if some data is initially unavailable, and handle unavailable or redundant data appropriately.

### Module 2:
- Data Understanding: Use descriptive statistics (univariate, pairwise correlations, histograms) to gain insights into the data.
- Data Quality: Address missing, invalid, or misleading data to ensure data accuracy.
- Data Preparation: Time-consuming step involving transforming and cleaning data for modeling.
- Modelling: Develop descriptive or predictive models based on the analytical approach chosen.
- Evaluation: Assess whether the model answers the initial question and make adjustments if needed.
- Diagnostic Measures: Use tools such as receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve to evaluate model performance.

### Module 3:
- Deployment: Introduce stakeholders to the developed tool or solution.
- Feedback: Gather feedback from stakeholders and use it to improve the model.
- Iterative Process: Continuously refine the model based on feedback and new data sources.
- Application of Methodology: Apply the data science methodology to real case studies to achieve business goals.
- Value of Methodology: Incorporate data science practices into daily analysis and reporting functions, and solve problems effectively.
- Importance of Order and Tools: Success in data science depends on using the right tools in the right order to address the problem at hand.
