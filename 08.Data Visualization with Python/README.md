# Data Visualization with Python
## üìë Summary
This course focuses on presenting and visualizing complex data in an understandable way, allowing for easy insights. It utilizes Python data visualization libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Folium to examine Canadian immigration data. Additionally, it covers creating dashboards with Plotly Dash and includes a final project that combines the skills learned to analyze and report on the performance of US domestic airline flights in a dashboard.

## üîë Key Skills Learned
- Introduction to Data Visualization Tools
- Basic and Specialized Visualization Tools
- Advanced Visualizations and Geospatial Data
- Dashboard creation using Plotly Dash.
