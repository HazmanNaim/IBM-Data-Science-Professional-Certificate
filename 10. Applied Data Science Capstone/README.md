# Applied Data Science Capstone
## üìë Summary
This capstone project involves predicting the success of Falcon 9‚Äôs first stage landing. SpaceX offers Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of 62 million dollars, which is significantly lower than other providers who charge upwards of 165 million dollars. This is largely due to SpaceX‚Äôs ability to reuse the first stage. By determining the success of the first stage landing, the cost of a launch can be estimated, which can be useful for companies bidding against SpaceX for rocket launches. This module provides an overview of the problem and the tools needed to complete the course.

## üìë Summary of Learning
### Data Collection
- Making GET requests to the SpaceX REST API
- Web Scraping
### Data Wrangling
- Using the .fillna() method to remove NaN values
- Using the .value_counts() method to determine the following:
- Number of launches on each site
- Number and occurrence of each orbit
- Number and occurrence of mission outcome per orbit type
- Creating a landing outcome label that shows the following:
- 0 when the booster did not land successfully
- 1 when the booster did land successfully
### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Using SQL queries to manipulate and evaluate the SpaceX dataset
- Using Pandas and Matplotlib to visualize relationships between variables, and determine patterns
### Interactive Visual Analytics
- Geospatial analytics using Folium
- Creating an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash
### Predictive Analysis (Classification)
- Using Scikit-Learn to:
- Pre-process (standardize) the data
- Split the data into training and testing data using train_test_split
- Train different classification models
- Find hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
- Plotting confusion matrices for each classification model
- Assessing the accuracy of each classification model
